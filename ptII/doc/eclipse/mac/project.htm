    <h1><a name="SettingUp">Setting up Eclipse to manage your Ptolemy II development environment</a></h1>

    <p>Eclipse will manage your ptII code tree as a <em>project</em> called
      the ptII project.  </p>
    <p>The Ptolemy II source code is available in two formats:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>The stable release - download a tar file that is created annually.</li>
      <li>The development version - access the Ptolemy group version control system, available via Github.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>The advantage of the tar file is that it is tested and stable.</p>
    <p>The advantage of the development version is that it has the
      latest and greatest changes.  However, there could be bugs and
      instability in the development version.

    <!--/eclipseSimple-->
    <p>There two ways to set up the ptII project:</p>
    <ol>
      <li> <a href="noVC.htm" target="main">Eclipse is <b>unaware</b> of the version control aspects of the project.</a>
	<br/>If you are downloading the source from major Ptolemy release,
	and don't want to update regularly, or you do not have network access, then use this choice.
	<br/><i>(No <code>git</code> from the command line).</i>
      </li>

      <li> <a href="eclipseVC.htm" target="main">Eclipse is <b>aware</b> of the Version Control aspects of the project.</a>
        <br/><i>(Use both the Eclipse Git plugin and optionally the
	shell <code>git</code> command).</i>

	<br/>This choice is the <b>preferred</b> choice for collaborating with the Ptolemy group because it means that your Ptolemy II tree can get recent changes.
	<br/>The downside is that that the development tree is under development, so there may be bugs or instability.

      </li>

    </ol>
