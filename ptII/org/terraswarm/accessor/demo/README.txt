This directory is for larger CapeCode Swarmlet applications that use multiple
accessors in non-trivial ways.

In general, module-specific CapeCode Swarmlet demonstrations should be
located in corresponding modules directory in
$PTII/ptolemy/actor/lib/jjs/modules/*/demo/.

If you add a demonstration here, be sure to update
$PTII/ptolemy/configs/doc/completeDemos.htm and
$PTII/ptolemy/configs/capecode/demonstrations.htm
