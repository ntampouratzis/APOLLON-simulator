/**
 * The Ptolemy-HLA co-simulation framework leverages two open source tools:
 * Ptolemy II and HLA/CERTI to enable construction in Ptolemy II of an HLA
 * federate.
 * </p>
 * <h2>About HLA</h2>
 * <p>
 * The High Level Architecture (HLA) [1][2] is a standard for distributed
 * discrete-event simulation. A simulation in HLA is called an HLA
 * federation. A federation is a collection of federates, typically modeling
 * components in a system, interconnected by a Run Time Infrastructure (RTI).
 * Each federate may be running on a different machine, and the RTI enables
 * them to send each other time-stamped events and ensures that the time
 * stamps respect DE semantics. The coordination between federates is handled
 * by a process called the RTIG, for RTI Gateway, which may be running
 * on a remote machine. Specifically, time advance in each of the
 * federates is coordinated by the RTIG so that events never arrive with time stamps
 * that are in the past with respect to the current time of the federate.
 * In Ptolemy II, a federate is a DE model with an instance of this HlaManager.
 * The model can contain composite actors with other models of computation, using
 * the ContinuousDirector for example.
 * </p><p>
 * This framework has been tested with an open-source RTI implementation
 * called CERTI [4]. In principle, it should work with other RTI implementations.
 * CERTI is implemented in C++, and an API called JCERTI is provided for Java.
 * Ptolemy II uses JCERTI.  CERTI also provides a Python API, so in principle,
 * a Ptolemy II federate should be able to interact with a federate written
 * in Python. For more about CERTI, see:
 * <a href="http://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/certi" target="_top">http://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/certi</a>.
 * </p>
 * <h2>Creating a Federate</h2>
 * <p>
 * To create a federate, in a Ptolemy model with a DE director, instantiate
 * an instance of this HLAManager. You will need to set the federationName
 * parameter to the name of the federation and
 * the <i>federateName</i> parameter to a unique name for the federate (unique
 * to the federation).
 * If, when running the model, there is no federation with the specified
 * name, then a federation with that name will be automatically created.
 * Otherwise, the federate will join the pre-existing federation.
 * </p><p>
 * Federates can exchange information using actors that implement
 * the {@link HlaUpdatable} and {@link HlaReflectable} interfaces,
 * such as {@link HlaAttributeUpdater} and {@link HlaAttributeReflector},
 * respectively. When a time-stamped event in one
 * federate is fed into an HlaUpdatable, then a corresponding time-stamped
 * event will pop out of any HlaReflectable elsewhere in the federation
 * if the parameters of that HlaReflectable match those of the
 * HlaUpdatable. These parameters conform to a
 * Federation Object Model (FOM) that is an important part of the
 * definition of a federation and is described in a file called a
 * Federation Execution Data (FED) file that needs to be
 * available to this HlaManager. More about this later.
 * </p>
 * <h2>Time-Stamped Communication</h2>
 * <p>
 * When a time-stamped event is sent from one federate to another
 * through the RTI,
 * the relationship of the received time stamp compared to the sent
 * time stamp depends on the parameters of the two HlaManagers at
 * each end of the communication.
 * First, the parameter <i>timeManagementService</i> selects between two
 * styles called "Next Event Request (NER)" and
 * "Time Advancement Request (TAR)".
 * We explain these in order.
 * </p><p>
 * The NER style is the default, and it is the most natural for use
 * with DE models. When <i>timeManagementService</i> specifies NER at both
 * the sending and receiving federate, then
 * the received time stamp is simply equal to the sent time stamp
 * plus the value of the <i>hlaLookahead</i> parameter of the sending
 * federate. So logically, there
 * is a "model-time delay" equal to <i>hlaLookahead</i> in each
 * communication.  The <i>hlaLookahead</i> is required to be strictly
 * greater than zero (this significantly simplifies distributed
 * coordination).
 * </p><p>
 * It rarely makes sense in a DE federate to use the TAR style,
 * and the result of using it is much more complicated.
 * The easiest way to understand the effect is to consider that
 * the time stamp may be modified first at the sending federate
 * and then again at the receiving federate. If the sending
 * federate is NER, then it simply increments the time stamp
 * by its <i>hlaLookahead</i>. If the receiving federate is NER, then
 * it makes no modification to the received time stamp. It uses whatever
 * it receives. Hence, if both ends are NER, the total modification
 * to the time stamp is to increment it by the <i>hlaLookahead</i> value at the sender.
 * But the situation is much more complicated if either end
 * uses TAR.
 * </p><p>
 * Suppose a sending federate is using TAR. In this case,
 * both <i>hlaLookahead</i> and the <i>hlaTimeStep</i> parameter may affect
 * the time stamp. Specifically, if the sender has an event
 * with time stamp equal to or greater than
 * <i>N</i> times <i>hlaTimeStep</i> and less than
 * <i>N</i> times <i>hlaTimeStep</i> plus <i>hlaLookahead</i>,
 * for any integer <i>N</i>, then the
 * time stamp will be modified by the sender to equal
 * <i>N</i> times <i>hlaTimeStep</i> plus <i>hlaLookahead</i>.
 * Otherwise, the time stamp is unmodified by the sender.
 * </p><p>
 * For example, if the sender has <i>hlaTimeStep</i> = 10 and
 * <i>hlaLookahead</i> = 2 and it wishes to send an event with
 * time stamp 1, the time stamp will be modified to 2,
 * introducing a delay of 1.
 * If it wants to send an event with time stamp 11,
 * the time stamp will be modified to 12.
 * </p><p>
 * Suppose a receiving federate is using TAR. In this
 * case, the time stamp of any incoming event will be
 * modified to equal the next largest (or equal)
 * multiple of the receiver's <i>hlaTimeStep</i>, i.e.
 * <i>M</i> times <i>hlaTimeStep</i> for some integer <i>M</i>.
 * </p><p>
 * For example, if a receiving federate of the previous message
 * whose time stamp was modified to 2 uses TAR with
 * <i>hlaTimeStep</i> = 5, then the time stamp will be modified
 * from 2 to 5, thereby getting a total delay of 4.
 * If the receiving federate uses NER, on the other
 * hand, the time stamp will not be modified by the receiver.
 * It will be received with time stamp 2.
 * </p><p>
 * If the sending federate is using NER and the receiving federate
 * is using TAR, then the sending federate will first modify the
 * time stamp by adding its <i>hlaLookahead</i> to the time stamp,
 * and then the receiving federate will further modify the time
 * stamp to make it equal to the least larger multiple of its
 * <i>hlaTimeStep</i>.
 * </p>
 * <h2>Exchanging Data</h2>
 * <p>
 * In HLA, the data that is sent from one federate to another through
 * the RTI is viewed
 * as an update to an attribute of an instance of a class.
 * Actors implementing the
 * {@link HlaUpdatable} and {@link HlaReflectable} interfaces specify
 * which attribute of which instance of which class they update
 * or are notified of updates.
 * See the documentation for {@link HlaAttributeUpdater} and
 * {@link HlaAttributeReflector}.
 * </p><p>
 * A Federation requires a Federation Execution Data (FED) file [7],
 * which defines classes and specifies which attributes a class contains.
 * The location of the FED file is given by two parameters of
 * this HlaManager, <i>fedFile</i> and <i>fedFileOnRTIG</i>.
 * Unfortunately, in HLA, the FED file is not a networked resource,
 * and it is needed by both the Ptolemy II federate and the RTIG,
 * and these may not be running on the same machine. So the locations
 * of the two files may be different.
 * By default, <i>fedFileOnRTIG</i> is set to "$fedFile", which
 * makes it the same as whatever you specify in the <i>fedFile</i>
 * parameter. This will usually work if the RTIG is being run
 * on the same machine as the federate, and will always work if
 * the federate itself launches the RTIG by setting the
 * <i>launchRTIG</i> parameter.
 * </p>
 * <h2>Environment Variables</h2>
 * <p>
 * CERTI, which is the implementation of HLA that Ptolemy II uses,
 * relies on some environment variables in order to execute:
 * <ul>
 * <li> CERTI_HOST, which provides the IP address of the machine that hosts the RTIG,
 * <li> CERTI_HOME, which provides the path to your installation of CERTI,
 * <li> CERTI_FOM_PATH which provides the default directory where the FED files are.
 *   This variable is needed if the FED file is not in the directory where the
 *   RTIG is launched.
 * <li> PATH must be updated with $CERTI_HOME/bin, so the binaries can be found,
 *   e.g., rtig and rtia.
 * <li> LD_LIBRARY_PATH and DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH must be updated with $CERTI_HOME/lib,
 *   the directory where the libRTI, libFedTime, libCERTId libraries are
 *   implemented.
 * </ul>
 * CERTI provides a script <i>myCERTI_env.sh</i> that set all the above
 * environment variables. The script is located in $CERTI_HOME/share/scripts and
 * must be run before a federation simulation.
 *
 * By default, the script <i>myCERTI_env.sh</i> set CERTI_HOST=localhost. This
 * specifies that the RTIG host is the local machine. If you are connecting to
 * a remote RTIG, you need to specify the IP address or domain name of that machine.
 * To set it, before launching Ptolemy II, you can execute a command like:
 * <pre>
 *    export CERTI_HOST=IP_address
 * </pre>
 * </p><p>
 * The environment variable CERTI_HOME is required
 * only if you wish the federate to launch an RTIG, something you specify
 * with the <i>launchRTIG</i> parameter.  If you wish the federate to launch
 * an RTIG, then you must set CERTI_HOME equal to the path to your
 * installation of CERTI, and you must set your PATH environment variable
 * to include the share/scripts and bin directories of your CERTI installation.
 * </p><p>
 * Notice that if the script <i>myCERTI_env.sh</i> is executed, all environment
 * variables are set and the RTIG can be launched executing a command line
 * (like <i>rtig</i>) or by the Ptolemy federate as explained above.
 * </p><p>
 * Sometime in the future, these environment variables may be replaced
 * or supplemented by parameters added to this HlaManager.
 * See also the {@link CertiRtig} class.
 * </p>
 * <h2>Lifecycle of Execution of a Federate</h2>
 * <p>
 * When a Ptolemy II federate starts executing, this HlaManager attempts
 * to connect to an RTIG running on the host specified by CERTI_HOST.
 * If this fails, and if <i>launchRTIG</i>
 * is set to true, and CERTI_HOST is either "localhost" or "127.0.0.1",
 * then this HlaManager will attempt to launch an RTIG on the local
 * machine.  This will require that the rtig executable be in your
 * PATH and that CERTI_HOME be specified, as explained above.
 * </p><p>
 * Once the federate has connected to the RTIG, it will attempt to
 * join the federation whose name is given by <i>federationName</i>.
 * If there is no such federation, then it will create it and then
 * join it.
 * </p><p>
 * After joining the federation, if <i>synchronizeStartTo</i> is
 * not empty, then it will stall the execution until the
 * synchronization point named in <i>synchronizeStartTo</i> is
 * reached by all federates in the federation.
 * If <i>synchronizeStartTo</i> is the same as <i>federateName</i>,
 * then it is <i>this</i> federate that registers the synchronization
 * point with the HLA. In that case, this federate should be last one launched.
 * All other federates that name this federate in their
 * <i>synchronizeStartTo</i> parameters will be waiting for
 * a message from the RTIG when all federates have reached this point,
 * and now the coordinated simulation can begin.
 * <b>NOTE:</b> If any federate fails to reach this synchronization point,
 * then the entire federation will be frozen in its initialization.
 * Consequently, <i>every</i> federate must have the same value for
 * <i>synchronizeStartTo</i>.
 * </p><p>
 * The simulation then executes like a normal DE simulation, except
 * that it may be stalled waiting for the RTI to permit time to advance.
 * This HlaManager implements the Ptolemy II TimeRegulator interface,
 * which enables it to regulate the advancement of time in the DEDirector.
 * The parameters <i>isTimeConstrained</i> and <i>isTimeRegulator</i> can be used
 * to decouple the advancement of time of the DEDirector from that of the RTI,
 * but this is rarely a good idea. For more details about time management
 * during execution, see [8].
 * </p><p>
 * The DEDirector in the model is required to have a finite <i>stopTime</i>
 * parameter set. It is usually also a good idea to set its
 * <i>stopWhenQueueIsEmpty</i> parameter to false, particularly if it
 * is relying on an HlaReflectable actor to provide it with events to process.
 * Otherwise, the federate may prematurely finish its simulation.
 * </p><p>
 * When the simulation ends, the federate resigns from the federation.
 * When all federates have resigned, the last federate destroys the federation.
 * In addition, if one of the federates launched the RTIG, and if
 * that federate's <i>killRTIG</i> parameter is set to true, then
 * that federate will also kill the RTIG.
 * </p><p>
 * This HlaManager provides extensive debug output. Listen to the attribute to get
 * the details. Some of these messages, primarily those related to the lifecycle of
 * the interaction with the RTI, are also printed to standard out, even if you are
 * listening to the attribute.
 * </p><p>
 * The <i>useCertiMessageBuffer</i> parameter works together with the
 * <i>attributeType</i> parameter to interpret the bits that are transported
 * over the RTI. Specifically, an HLA RTI will transport arbitrary byte sequences
 * regardless of what they represent.  CERTI, the particular RTI that Ptolemy II
 * uses, provides a convenience feature that packs and unpacks the message bytes
 * for a small set of data types.  This feature takes into account the annoyance
 * that the byte order can be different on different platforms (big endian or
 * little endian). If the attribute that this actor is listening to is updated
 * by a "foreign" federate (not implemented in Ptolemy II), then this
 * <i>useCertiMessageBuffer</i> parameter should be set to true to ensure that
 * byte order changes are handled. And in this case, only the small set of data
 * types supported by CERTI can be used.  On the other hand, if the attribute
 * is updated by a Ptolemy II model, and that update does not not specify
 * to use the CERTI message buffer, then this parameter should be false.
 * </p>
 * <p>NOTE FOR DEVELOPERS:
 * A federate needs to instruct the RTI that it is prepared to receive one or more
 * callbacks. The way to do it was not in the HLA 1.3 standard and was introduced
 * in the HLA IEEE 1516 standard. JCERTI, the Java API, is compliant only with DoD HLA 1.3
 * even though CERTI (coded with C++) is compliant with both standards. JCERTI
 * provides three different methods for receiving a callback: tick(),
 * tick(min,max) and tick2(). When a federate calls the tick() method, any
 * callbacks that are pending are invoked, and then the tick() returns.
 * If there are no pending callbacks, then it returns immediately.
 * This HLAManager, uses tick(min, max), which is not documented and we can't
 * be sure what it does, but it seems that the min argument specifies the
 * maximum real time to block waiting for a callback
 * before returning, and the second argument is not used. But we really can't
 * be sure without carefully evaluating all the C++ code.
 * The alternative, tick2(), is not an attractive alternative because it
 * blocks until a callback occurs, and a callback may never occur.
 * This results in the HLAManager freezing, which freezes the Ptolemy model
 * and Vergil, the user interface.

     *  <p>
     *  This method implements the TimeRegulator
     *  interface by calling the HLA/CERTI Time Management services for
     *  a time advance request. The time advance phase in HLA is a two-step
     *  process: 1) a federate sends a time advance request service and
     *  2) waits for the time to be granted by the timeAdvanceGrant
     *  (TAG) service. Two services, both with  lookahead &gt; 0 are implemented:
     *  - timeAdvanceRequest() (TAR) for implementing time-stepped Federates;
     *  - nextEventRequest() (NER) for implementing event-based Federates.
     *  While this method is blocked waiting for the TAG, some attribute may be
     *  reflected with a time stamp less than the proposed time. In this case,
     *  the time returned by this method depends on whether TAR or NER is being
     *  used. If NER is being used, the time returned by this method will equal
     *  the value of that time stamp. If TAR is being used, the time returned
     *  always equals the proposedTime. This allows the director to properly
     *  handle that reflected attribute value at the time of its time stamp. If
     *  no attribute is reflected while this method is blocked, the time
     *  returned always equals the proposedTime no matter which service is
     *  used, NER or TAR.
     *  <p>
     *  In fact, this method deals with two timelines: the Ptolemy timeline,
     *  where a time value is represented by an instance of the Time class,
     *  and HLA timeline, where time is represented by a double. When this
     *  method is called with some Time value t, this method will convert this
     *  to a double using HLA time units, which may result in some loss of
     *  precision. The RTI will respond by granting an HLA logical time h,
     *  a double, which is less than or equal to the proposed time.
     *  It will be less than if some other event from some other federate has
     *  occurred with a time less than the proposed time (depending on NER, TAR,
     *  and many other factors). If the granted time matches the proposed time
     *  (in HLA's double representation of time), then this method will return
     *  the exact proposedTime Time object, thereby avoiding the quantization
     *  errors of conversion. In other words, if the HLA grants the proposed time,
     *  this method returns the proposedTime with no quantization error.
     *
     *  @param proposedTime The proposed time in Ptolemy time.
     *  @return The proposed time or a smaller time t', in Ptolemy time.
