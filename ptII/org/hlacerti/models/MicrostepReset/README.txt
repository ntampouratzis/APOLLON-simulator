All federations in this folder were not yet updated to the new HlaManager design
from commit 2ac9ee7576c Jan 14 2019.

Remark: after updating to new HlaManager refactoring, these models need to be 
tested again. The "microstep reset" bug would be fixed.
The models in org.hlacerti.models.MicrostepOK has a correct execution.
