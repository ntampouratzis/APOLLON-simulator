These files are test models for the HLA/Certi cosimulation framework, for revision
71943. In this revision, a federate can discover multiple (static) instances of a class.
Static means that the user must put as many HlaSubscribers as HLA instances.

In this scenario each "bille" (ball) is published by a federate (in a different Ptolemy model): Bille1 by BillardBall1.xml and Bille2 by BillardBall2.xml.

BillardTable.xml is a federate which can display up to 3 instances of billard and it is the
same than in folder "billard".

Open the file 2Billes2Fed.xml and follow the instructions.
