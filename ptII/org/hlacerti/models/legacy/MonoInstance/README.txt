These demos work only for revision 71843 of HLA/Certi cosimulation framework. 
In this revision, a federate can discover only one instance of a class.
It is a so called Mono Instance version.

The hlacerti framework was moved from $PTII/ptolemy/apps/ to $PTII/org/ on r71890.

The demo $PTII/ptolemy/apps/hlacerti/demo/CoSimulation on revision 71843 has
(on July, 2017) a compilation error for C++ federates and it was copied in this folder.

The demo $PTII/ptolemy/apps/hlacerti/demo/CoSimulationNetwork1 was not copied neither.
