This folder contains two similar demos:
- 2Billes2Fed: two federates BillardBall1.xml and BillardBall2.xml, each one registering/publishing a ball instance, and a third one, BillardTable.xml that displays the two ball
instances.

- 2Billes1Fed: one federate TwoBillardBalls.xml that registering/publishing two ball
instances, and a second one, BillardTable.xml that displays the two ball instances.
A third federate, SingleBillardBall.xml can also be launched in this federation.

- Others: 
  - DisplayWithFedName.xml. It works only when launched with one federate, e.g.,
    2Billes1Fed/SingleBillardBall.xml. A text file is created during the running and named
    as the publishing instance, e.g., billiard Bille1A. Does not work with 2 instances.
  - Autorun.xml must be corrected. It needs Synchro.xml (still in this folder) and 
   federates publishing the ball and display it (they can be taken from 2Billes1Fed or
   2Billes2Fed).
  - Federate DisplayWithoutPort.xml does not work and will be deleted. 

Both demo 2Billes1Fed  and 2Billes2Fed  can interact with C++ federates.

Interaction with C++ federates:
-------------------------------
For having a correct interaction between C++ and Ptolemy billiard federates, the patched version of billiard.cc must be used (/** pour recevoir la nouvelle position de la bille en 2 RAV avec un seul attribut par RAV */).

There should be no memory effect with BilliarTable when running several simulations in a row. But in case of doubt, I advice to close it and re-open.


1-  BilliardTable with N C++ federate (in BilliardTable, Make sure that you disable the synchronization point in the HlaManager)
* kill rtig if need and launch it back.
* launch the C++ billard first
* Launch BilliardTable and SingleBillardBall (or TwoBilliardBalls) and the N-1 C++ billard
* Get back to the first C++ billard and press ENTER

or : run 2Billes1Fed.xml (or 2Billes2Fed.xml)  and follow the instructions

Launch order does not matter between Ptolemy federates when using Billard.cc
because the C++ federate is the register of the synchronization point.
