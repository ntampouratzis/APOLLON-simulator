Steps for automatically creating a Ptolemy file with only the links to the models of folder:

- The folder in $PTII/org/hlacerti/demo must be named with first upper case letter, e.g.,
  FolderName;
- The Ptolemy file is created inside FolderName and is named FolderName.xml;
- The command line must be launched at $PTII, e.g.:

$PTII/bin/mkptlivelinkdemo org/hlacerti/demo/Billard/Others > org/hlacerti/demo/Billard/Others/Others.xml

The file can then be updated with additional text if necessary.

Remark: $PTII and $PWD must be exactly the same, e.g., with no extra "/" in $PTII.
