/**
 A timed merge actor for the DE domain. It merges a set of input signals
 into a single output signal based on the order of the tags
 associated with the events of signals. A tag is a tuple of a timestamp
 (as an instance of Time) and a microstep or index (as non-negative integer).
 Tags have a lexicographic order.
 <p>
 This actor has an input port (a multiport) and an output port
 (a single port). The types of the ports are undeclared and will be
 resolved by the type resolution mechanism, with the constraint that
 the output type must be greater than or equal to the input type.
 <p>
 There is a boolean parameter <i>discardEvents</i> associated
 with this actor, which decides how to handle simultaneously
 available inputs.
 <p>
 If the <i>discardEvents</i> parameter is configured to true,
 then each time this actor fires, it reads the first
 available token from an input channel and send it to the output
 port.  Then this actor discards all the remaining inputs in the rest of
 channels.
 <p>
 If the <i>discardEvents</i> parameter is configured to false (the default),
 then the handling of simultaneous events is a bit more subtle.
 On each firing, it reads at most one input from each input channel
 in the order of the channels and puts them on a queue to be produced
 as an output. It then takes the first token (the oldest one) from the queue
 and produces it on the output. If after this firing the queue is not empty,
 then it requests a refiring at the current time.
