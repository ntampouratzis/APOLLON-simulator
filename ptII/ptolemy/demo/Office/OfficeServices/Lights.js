/** Accessor for the Lights service. 
 *  This accessor sends messages to the Lights model via a web socket.
 *  It has embedded in it the IP address of the host running the Lights model.
 *  The Lights model, when it executes, modifies that IP address to conform
 *  with the IP address of whatever server is running the Lights model
 *  and then publishes this accessor, modified with the correct IP address,
 *  to a KeyValueStoreServer running on the same host.
 *  
 *  On startup, this accessor sends to the schema output a description of the
 *  control input that it expects.  It also sends null to the data output to
 *  signal anything downstream that it is starting up.
 *
 *  @accessor Lights
 *  @author Edward A. Lee (eal@eecs.berkeley.edu)
 *  @input control A JSON object of the form {"mood":"moodname"}, where 
 *   moodname is one of the supported mood names as indicated in the schema
 *   output.
 *  @output data A JSON object of the form {"response":"OK"} or
 *   {"response":"error message"} to indicate whether the
 *   command has suceeded.
 *  @output schema Upon initialization, this output port produces a JSON object that
 *   is a schema for the JSON expected on the control input. This schema
 *   conforms to the JSON schema standard at http://json-schema.org/.
