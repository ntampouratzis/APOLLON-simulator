/** Accessor for the Sensors service. 
 *  This accessor subscribes to a web socket that is published to by the Sensors service
 *  and produces the parsed JSON messages received on that socket on its output.
 *  It has embedded in it the IP address of the host running the Sensors model.
 *  The Sensors model, when it executes, modifies that IP address to conform
 *  with the IP address of whatever server is running the Sensors model
 *  and then publishes this accessor, modified with the correct IP address,
 *  to a KeyValueStoreServer running on the same host.
 *  
 *  On startup, this accessor sends null to the data output to
 *  signal anything downstream that it is starting up.
 *
