Assume a solid ball of mass $m$ and radius $r_b$
at radius $r$ from a pivot point attached by a massless arm with length $r$.
The angle of the arm is $\theta$, a function of time.
The torque applied to the arm is $\tau$, positive in the counterclockwise direction.
By the parallel axis theorem, the moment of inertia is given by
\[
I = m \left(r^2 + \frac{2}{5} r_b^2\right).
\]
The angular version of Newton's second law is
\[
\tau = I \ddot{\theta} .
\]
The torque due to gravity, assuming it is applied only at the center of the ball, is given by
\[
\tau_g = - mrg \cos \theta,
\]
where $g = 9.81$ m/s$^2$ is the acceleration of gravity at sea level.
Hence, we have:
\[
\ddot{\theta} = \frac{\tau + \tau_g}{I} = \frac{\tau - m r g \cos \theta}{m \left(r^2 + \frac{2}{5} r_b^2\right)}
\]
