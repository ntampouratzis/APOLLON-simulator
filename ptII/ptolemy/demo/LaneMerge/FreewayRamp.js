/** Model of a freeway entrance ramp that delays merge requests until
 *  it is safe to merge and also provides a roadside service
 *  that suggests a ramp speed that will result in smooth joining on the
 *  freeway. This model accepts input events at the freewayCar port that
 *  represent cars on the freeway approaching the ramp entrance. It also
 *  accepts input events at the rampCar port, and in response to those
 *  events, provides a suggestedRampSpeed output. These events represent
 *  cars approaching the entrance on the ramp. Finally, it accepts
 *  events at the merge port, representing cars on the ramp that have
 *  arrived at the ramp entrance. In response to these events, it waits
 *  until the car can safely enter the freeway, and at that time,
 *  produces on the **merged** output the same data received on the **merge**
 *  input and produces a mergeTime output indicating the total amount of time
 *  that the car had to wait between arriving at the entrance and entering the
 *  freeway.
 *  
 *  This model makes a number of unrealistic simplications. First, the
 *  speed of cars on the freeway is fixed and independent of congestion.
 *  Second, It assumes that cars on the ramp accelerate instantaneously
 *  to the suggested speed and, once reaching the ramp entrace, can
 *  accelerate instantaneously to freeway speed.
 *

 *  and Control</i>, by Antonella Ferrara, Simona Sacone, and Silvia Siri,

 *  @parameter {number} sensorDistanceToMerge The distance in kilometers
 *   between a car sensor on the freeway and the ramp entrance. This is
 *   a number that defaults to 2.0.
 *  @parameter {number} freewaySpeed The speed of cars on the freeway in
 *   kilometers per hour.
 *  @parameter {number} rampLength The distance between the sensor that
 *   sees cars at the rampCar position and the freeway entrance (in
 *   kilometers). This is a number that defaults to 0.5
 *  @parameter {number} maxRampSpeed The maximum speed on the ramp in
 *   kilometers per hour. This is a number that defaults to 60.
 *  @parameter {number} minSpacing The minimum spacing between cars
 *   for a car to safely enter the freeway in kilometers. This is a
 *   number that defaults to 0.05.
 *   
 *  @input freewayCar An event indicating that a car on the freeway 
 *   is approaching the ramp entrace. At the time of this event, the car
 *   is distance sensorDistanceToMerge prior to the merge.
 *  @input rampCar An event indicating that a car on the ramp 
 *   is approaching the ramp entrace. At the time of this event, the car
 *   is distance rampLength prior to the merge.
 *  @input merge An event indicating that a car on the ramp 
 *   has arrived at the ramp entrace. At the time of this event, the car
 *   is exactly at the merge.
 *  
 *  @output {number} output The output for the doubled value.
