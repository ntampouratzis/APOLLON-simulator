    </p>

    <h3>CapeCode.app</h3>
    <p>
      Under Mac OS X, CapeCode
      includes <code>$PTII/bin/CapeCode.app</code>,
      where <code>$PTII</code> is the location where CapeCode was
      installed.  Users that want to run CapeCode under Mac OS X
      typically double click on <code>CapeCode.app</code>.
    </p>

    <h3>$PTII/bin/capecode</h3>
    <p>
      If you would like to extend or modify CapeCode, then set
      the <code>$PTII</code> environment variable to point to the
      location of your CapeCode tree.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is typically done by editing <code>~/.bashrc</code> and
      adding:
    </p>

    <pre>
      export PTII=/Applications/capecode0.3.devel
    </pre>

    <p>
      where <code>/Application/capecode0.3.devel</code> is the
      location where CapeCode was installed.
    </p>
    <p>After setting <code>$PTII</code>, to rebuild use:
    </p>
    <pre>
      cd $PTII
      ./configure
      $PTII/bin/ant
      $PTII/bin/capecode
    </pre>

    <h3>Details</h3>
    <p>
      Ptolemy II and CapeCode consist of multiple applications it it is
      expected that the user will browse the distribution, so we don't ship
      a single .app directory.  In addition, for support reasons, we want
      the distributions to be fairly uniform between the different
      platforms.
    </p>

    <p>
      In addition, we hope that most users will extend Ptolemy
      II/CapeCode and rebuild it.  Rebuilding Ptolemy II and CapeCode
      creates the Mac .app files in $PTII/bin.  If we had a top level .app
      file for CapeCode, this would clutter the top level directory.  In
      addition, for CapeCode, we would end up with $PTII/Vergil.app,
      $PTII/Ptiny.app, $PTII/CapeCode.app and possibly other .app files.
    </p>

    <p>
      Other multi-platform applications include a bin directory on the
      Mac that includes the .app directories.
